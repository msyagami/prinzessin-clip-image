        <p id="text">Fischl: I, Fischl, Prinzessin der Verurteilung, descend upon this land by the call of fate an— Oh,
            you are also a traveler from another world? Very well, I grant you permission to travel with me. Oz: She
            means "Nice to meet you." I hear the voice of fate, speaking my name in humble supplication... Hm-hm, may
            the glory of the Prinzessin bring light to this world. Fischl: I do worry about the well-being of my retinue
            during my impromptu absence... Oz: I'm sure the good people of the Adventurers' Guild are absolutely fine,
            mein Fräulein. Oh, the sun's out— *cough* Um... This meteorological transformation is most splendid! Like a
            felicitous twist of fate in the face of certain doom. Fischl: Hark! 'Tis Thundering Retribution, an omen of
            dark times ahead... Oz: That, and mein Fräulein's laundry is still on the line... Fischl: Wha... Seriously!?
            Fischl: Hm-hm. A wonderful sight indeed. Why, it reminds me of my home world, where at the sight of the
            Prinzessin der Verurteilung, the very blood and tears of sinners turn to ice! ...Atchoo! Atchoo! Oz: Not
            only their blood and tears, but also their saliva and mucus, mein Fräulein. Fischl: Oz— Ahh—Atchoo!!!
            Fischl: Ozzie, my dear familiar... Oz: "Ozzie?" What's gotten into you... Fischl: Her Majesty beseeches you
            to unfurl your blessèd wings, and with them blot out the heavens, plunging the world into eternal night...
            Oz: If you didn't bring your parasol with you, that's your own fault, mein Fräulein! Dusk and dawn but
            fleeting shadows are. Once more, the twists of fate have led you into my everlasting night. Oz: Good
            morning. Mein Fräulein heard you'd be dropping by, so she's preparing breakfast. Fischl: Oz! ...Ahem. To
            what do I owe the pleasure? Even one of royal blood finds oneself susceptible to drowsiness at this hour.
            Fischl: The stars of the firmament are naught but rifts, thrust open by Oz's beak into the boundless
            tapestry of darkness. Oz: You do say the strangest of things, mein Fräulein. Fischl: Sweet shall be thy
            sleep, spared of the mares of the night! For no night mares would dare draw near to those who are blessed by
            the Immernachtreich! Oz: She means "Goodnight." Fischl: Me? Hehehe. Remember thou this, that I, Fischl, am
            the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, Sovereign of Immernachtreich, omniscient and eminent judge of all the
            world's iniquity! Oz: She's an investigator for the Adventurers' Guild. Fischl: ...Ahem. That is but one of
            my many royal engagements. You and I are both travelers from another world. That our paths have crossed here
            is no accident, but the will of fate. You seem... troubled. Traveler, Do not lose heart! For with my left
            eye, the Auge der Verurteilung, which sees the threads of fate, I will surely keep you from harm. And Oz,
            the raven that has witnessed the demise of countless worlds, will watch over you on your journey. Should
            this world, like a beast prowling in the night, covet your dreams, then I, Prinzessin der Verurteilung,
            shall fell it with my ensorcelled arrows of judgment! Fischl: Oz, my loyal companion. That we should have
            met this person, one who hails from another world as I do... Perhaps even cruel fate has deigned to smile
            upon me, through sin courses through my veins. If I am indeed destined to remain here, in this inescapable
            prison that is reality, at least— Oz: I understand mein Fräulein! In this traveler, Fräulein has found one
            who will never forsake her. Fischl: Ozvaldo von Hrafnavines. I, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, sovereign
            of the Immernachtreich, do hereby call upon thee to do all within thy power to deliver the traveler from the
            claws of fate that would seek to snatch them at every turn, and to ready thy mind lest thou be required to
            make the ultimate sacrifice in the performance of this noblest of duties. Oz: ...You'd place my life in
            danger so easily, mein Fräulein? Oh? You inquire about my Edelstein der Dunkelheit? It is a royal heirloom,
            a ceremonial ornament that displays the majesty of the Prinzessin der Verurteilung before the unworthy. Even
            here, in this fallen world, I have been reunited with my rightful inheritance as one of royal blood and
            noble spirit, for the majesty of a true princess shall draw her royal heirlooms unto her wherever so she may
            roam. Fischl: If one must reckon time as this world does, I, Fischl, have already seen three thousand
            winters. Not that the illusory passage of time has any bearing on one such as I, to whom the causality of
            three thousand universes has been unveiled. Oz: Be that as it may, mein Fräulein. you are not yet considered
            to be of drinking age in this world, and no bartender can ever be convinced otherwise. Oz's full name is
            Ozvaldo von Hrafnavines. Where I hail from, he holds dominion over star and sky across three universes, and
            the souls of the mighty, fallen in battle, rest in the shadow of his wings. One should add that the penalty
            for mispronouncing his name is to have one's tongue torn from one's mouth. However, as I am a princess and
            you are one who has my favor, we are at liberty to simply call him, "Oz." To condemn the guilty, to sanctify
            the just, and to draw all castaway dreams into the embrace of infinite Immernachtreich. This is the
            birthright of the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, and her burden. None may gainsay it. My left eye? It is the
            all-seeing Auge der Verurteilung, which reveals all that is true in the world. As to the question of why I
            conceal it... Well, would you willingly bear the agony of piercing to the heart of all truths?
            Furthermore... the world would lose much of its appeal if wholly stripped of delusion and falsehood. Fischl:
            Stormterror? Why, one never would have thought that a being that one might have kept as her pet could, in
            this world, be capable of causing such calamity. *sigh* Pitiable are the incompetents of this world... Oz:
            That said, mein Fräulein, were you not beside yourself with worry for everyone's safety during said
            calamity? Fischl: T-That is because the Prinzessin der Verurteilung has the solemn duty to safeguard the
            souls of all, be they petty beings or not... Oz: Some people address her by other names. But to me, the one
            who gave me life and bestowed my powers upon me is Fischl, and none other. All things considered, Fischl is
            the name that most aptly captures her identity. Seriously, don't call her anything else, or— Fischl: Oh, how
            one's royal ears do burn! Pray tell, what is the matter which you discuss so furtively? Oz: Mid—Midnight
            Phantasmagoria, mein Fräulein! And... the majesty of Verurteilung name! Why must the Prinzessin der
            Verurteilung punish sin? Because sin defies fate's rightful decree, of course! ...And of course, fate
            brought you here, so, so... Ahem! It was fate that saw to your descent upon this world, destiny that saw our
            paths intertwined. I, Fischl, shall always protect you. Because... because fate has revealed to me that this
            is what has been decreed!</p>
